<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
<p1>My name is Jordan Pagkalinawan, a high school student who lives in Southern California.  Some of my interests include politics, basketball, and writing.  I've spent over half my life covering stories in my neighborhood and posting them to my <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO_Qcs7hE-BjM0E6fed6f0Q/featured?view_as=subscriber">YouTube channel.</a>  I'm also a musician, with experience singing and playing the drums, guitar, and piano.  Some of my hobbies include playing basketball, coding, and reading.  I'm an avid consumer of news and I love reading about the ways that journalism has changed society.  I'm also interested in seeing how programming will shape our world as devices are continuously added to restaurants, sporting arenas, and even around neighborhoods.
