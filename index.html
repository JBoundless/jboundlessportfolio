<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
<p>My name is Jordan Pagkalinawan, a high school student who lives in Southern California.  Some of my interests include politics, basketball, and writing.  I've spent over half my life covering stories in my neighborhood and posting them to my <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO_Qcs7hE-BjM0E6fed6f0Q/featured?view_as=subscriber">YouTube channel.</a>  I'm also a musician, with experience singing and playing the drums, guitar, and piano.  Some of my hobbies include playing basketball, coding, and reading.  I'm an avid consumer of news and I love reading about the ways that journalism has changed society.  I'm also interested in seeing how programming will shape our world as devices are continuously added to restaurants, sporting arenas, and even around neighborhoods.  Check out my other interests by clicking on the page headers above.</p>

<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>My role as a student is to constantly learn about new concepts and, when called for, apply them into my daily life.  That role continues to evolve as a student journalist and a computer programmer.  With journalism, I absorb current events as well as stories about the industry.  As a programmer, my interest in Web Development requires me to be creative and find new outlets for such creativity.
Personally, I still have a lot to learn with regards to my future.  It’s been cemented into my brain that journalism is for me.  I ponder what I could do in addition to a career in the news industry.  Given the option, do I minor in Computer Science to enhance my reporting skills?  Do I finally decide to pursue a Musical Theater minor because it’s another storytelling outlet?  Should I freelance with Data Visualization or with VIdeography?  These are the questions that, at the moment, I still do not know the answer to.  However, I find that I am lucky to have these options available.  Curious minds are what we need in the world today.  Whether we have the mindset of changing the world or just trying to figure out how we will spend our adult life, I believe it is crucial to prepare for the future so that we are not at a crossroads when we face these decisions.
