<h1>Journalism</h1>
<h2>YouTube</h2>
<p>I have covered local events in SoCal since I was seven years old.  Some of the stories I've reported on included the 2016 election, a hotel workers strike in San Francisco, and a train-versus-pedestrian accident.  My latest video can be found below.</p>

  <h3>Newspaper Experience </h3>
  <p>I spent my eighth grade year contributing to my middle school's newspaper.  I wrote and co-wrote several sports articles for them.  In high school, I spent two years as a varsity basketball reporter for my school newspaper, The Loyalist.  Some of my recent articles for them can be found in the Sports section.  My hard work paid off after I was chosen to be a Sports Editor for the 2020-21 staff.</p>
<h4>Medium Blog</h4>
<p>In November of 2019, I started a blog on Medium called The Voice of Truth.  Originally started as a news blog on <a href="https://thevoxtruth.wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>, it grew to a blog about the NBA and MLB.  With professional sports on hiatus, I decided that I would write about my programming journey on the site.</p>
<h5>Podcast</h5>
  <p>In August 2020, I launced an NBA Podcast called the 'Boundless & Ballin Podcast'.  More information about that can be found on the <a href="https://jboundless.github.io/jordanjpagkalinawan/PodcastPage.html">Podcast</a> Page of my website.</p>
