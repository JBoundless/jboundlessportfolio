<h1>Computer Programming</h1>
<p>I have spent three years learning how to code through Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp.  Besides HTML and CSS, the languages I've learned include Java, JavaScript, Python, and Swift.  Recently, I've been taking a course called 'Visualization for Data Journalism' on Coursera.  I've also been trying my hand at Virtual Reality by learning A-Frame on Codecademy.</p>

  <h3>Programming and Journalism</h3>
<p>I've always wondered how journalism and programming could coexist.  In these times, it has become apparent that newsrooms are beginning to accept the fact that technology could become a part of their workflow as well.  Some helpful articles on the issue include:</p>
