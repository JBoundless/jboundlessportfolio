<h1>Music</h1>
<p>I've been a musician my entire life.  I've been involved in choirs for school and church, and I took a Music 1 class in my sophomore year of high school.  I've been taught by several vocal coaches since I was nine.  I was even featured as an ensemble singer for the <a href="https://fasofoundation.org/">Filipino American Symphony Orchestra</a></p>
<h2>SoundCloud & Spotify</h2>
<p>My <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jordan-boundless">SoundCloud</a> includes recordings of covers I've sang, mixes of Broadway songs, and several LoFi tracks I produced.  My <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/21dep67i3jzh66dmrbi2br7by">Spotify</a> contains playlists of my favorite songs and genres.</p>
